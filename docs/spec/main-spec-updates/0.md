# Main Spec Update 0

***what actually happened during development***

---

Various things in the spec changed during the development process, which was considered *(by me)* to be acceptable, given the project was single-developer. However, they'll be listed here, so documentation exists for these changes.

## Backend

- Endpoints under `/api/` don't return a JSON 404, instead return the next.js 404 page. This is because Flask didn't seem to accept multiple error handlers. However, it is a 404 response code.
- It should be noted that the spec is inconsistent between 401/403 Unauthorised/Forbidden, sometimes even using the wrong code. For clarity, here is what is in the code (which matches the HTTP spec):
    | Code | Description  | Usage                                          |
    | :----| :------------| :----------------------------------------------|
    | 401  | Unauthorised | When an API token isn't provided               |
    | 403  | Forbidden    | When the API token isn't allowed to do a thing |
- Endpoints requiring a location of a dataset require the location to be on the S3 bucket associated to the genestack server the instance is connected to

### API Endpoints

- `/api/studies/` GET: JSON response is
```json
{
    "status": "OK",
    "data": [
        {
            "key": "value"
        }
    ]
}
```
- `/api/studies` GET: will return 500 code if something goes wrong in genestack package, with the exception args
- `/api/studies` POST: successful request will return (201)
```json
{
    "status": "OK",
    "data": {
        "accession": "GSF12345"
    }
}
```
- `/api/studies` POST can also return 403 if S3 bucket permission is denied, or 500 if something else goes wrong
- `/api/studies/{id}` GET can return a 500 code if something unknown goes wrong
- `/api/studies/{id}` POST will return 405 Method Not Allowed as editing study metadata was not implemented
- `/api/studies/{id}/signals` GET successful response is
```json
{
    "status": "OK",
    "data": {
        "studyAccession": "GSF12345",
        "signals": [
            {
                "signalDataKey": "signalDataValue"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
- `/api/studies/{id}/signals` GET can return a 500 code if something unknown goes wrong
- `/api/studies/{id}/signals` POST on success (201) return
```json
{
    "status": "OK",
    "data": "Created"
}
```
- `/api/studies/{id}/signals` POST can return a 403 if S3 bucket permission is denied
- `/api/studies/{id}/signals` POST can return a 500 if something unexpected goes wrong
- `/api/studies/{id}/signals/{signal_id}` GET successful response is:
```json
{
    "status": "OK",
    "data": {
        "studyAccession": "GSF12345",
        "signal": {
            "signalDataKey": "signalDataValue"
        }
    }
}
```
- `/api/studies/{id}/signals/{signal_id}` GET can return a 500 if something unexpected goes wrong
- `/api/studies/{id}/signals/{signal_id}` POST will return 405 Method Not Allowed, as editing signal metadata wasn't implemented

### Additional API Endpoints
(under `/api`, all can return `403 Forbidden` or `500 Internal Server Error`)
<table>

        <th>Endpoint</th>
        <th>Method</th>
        <th>Return Code</th>

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>/templates</code></td>
        <td>GET</td>
        <td>200 OK</td>

                "templateFieldDataKey": "templateFieldDataValue"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

## Frontend

### URLs
URL's now use the plural, so pages in the spec called `/study` and `/signal` are actually in the interface `/studies` and `/signals`.

### Usage
- The API token is stored in `localStorage`, along with the time it was set. If more than an hour passes, the user gets reprompted for the token.
- Pages don't have sidebars, except the page to view study information, which lists the signals linked to that study.
- Pages have a help button at the top, which opens a modal explaining how to use the page.
- Editing metadata of existing studies and signals is not part of this application. Therefore, `/studies/{study_id}` and `/studies/{study_id}/signals/{signal_id}` provide tables to view the information, without the ability to change it.
- The user fills out one form of information, and presses submit. This starts the workflow, and will show if it succeeds or fails, giving the error response on screen if it fails.
- The option to generate a minimal VCF isn't provided. In the original specification this is described as for an expression dataset, but instead it is meant to be for a variant dataset.

## Development Specification

*it doesn't help that this never was fully written in the first place. oops.*

### Backend

- Automatic strict type checking wasn't used due to the number of errors due to the lack of type hints in imported packages.
- The project is checked with `pylint` and the `.pylintrc` file provided. A GitHub action check this on push, and only passes if the code scores 10/10.
- A `requirements.txt` file is provided, however the `uploadtogenestack` package isn't included, as the GitHub action worker can't access it (as it is on Sanger's internal GitLab), so the action would always fail

### Frontend
- The frontend is in the `frontend` directory, and created using `create-next-app`.
- Files giving a react component have the filetype `.jsx`.
- API calls, and checks to ensure a valid API token is set are defined in `utils/api.js`.
- A component for displaying a help text modal is in `utils/HelpModal.jsx`.

### Docker

The provided Dockerfile will build the frontend, get a Python image, download and build `bcftools`, copy the repository, install the dependencies (including `uploadtogenestack` so it must be built on the Sanger network). When running, it will run the Flask app using waitress.

The style for tagging Docker images is `mercury/genestack-uploader:X.Y.{dev|prod}`, where `X.Y` is the version number, and `dev` or `prod` is for which endpoint is specified in `.env` as the base URL for the entire application. As the Next app needs building, this file must be updated pre-build, so the image should be tagged with the information about what URL is baked into the image.

Docker usage instructions are given in the README.
